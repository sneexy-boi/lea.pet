# Terms of Service

Hi! You've probably stumbled across this because you're using (or trying to use) one of my self-hosted services. Welcome!

If the service you are using or wish to use has a public registration form, you are welcome to create an account and make use the service as detailed below. \
If you have received an invitation to a private service, the terms below still apply. If you have gained unauthorized access to a service, **please [report it](#contact) immediately.**

### Conditions

If you wish to use the service, you must abide by the following rules:

- **Stay civil.** \
  Homophobia, transphobia, racism, or otherwise demeaning or harassing individuals or groups of people will immediately result in termination.
- **Stay within the law.** \
  Don't do anything that would violate your local or German law. We don't want you to get us in trouble, and in case of a legal complaint we will have to forward your contact info.
- **Abuse.** \
  Only use services in the way they were designed to be used, especially if the misuse results in service degradation for other users. If in doubt, ask first.
- **Moderator discretion.** \
  The above are just general guidelines. If your behaviour is unfit, Administrators may terminate your access at any point.

# Privacy Policy

As I am not able to write a privacy policy tailored to every individual service, this policy is overly broad. Obviously I deeply respect and honour the privacy and data safety of every user and do my best to protect it.

### Collected data

Any data you provide to the service may be stored as required for service operation and abuse prevention. The details vary from service to service, but unless noted otherwise you can assume everything you provide is stored until you delete it or it is no longer needed.

### Data sharing

Your data may be shared with third parties if it is required for service operation, for example when federating with other Fediverse servers. All data you upload or provide in private will stay private!

My services are protected by [CrowdSec](https://www.crowdsec.net/). If it detects malicious behaviour coming from your IP address, the IP address and certain other data may be sent to CrowdSec - Please refer to [their privacy policy](https://www.crowdsec.net/privacy-policy).

### GDPR

If you wish to make use of your GDPR given rights to data deletion, correction or similar, feel free to [contact me](#contact)! \
I'm also open to answering general questions :)

### Secrecy

Private information will stay private. I do not look through your files, unless I have concrete suspicions of illegal content. If I am suspending your access, I will let you know first (unless you are in *deep* violation of the law or the [conditions](#conditions)).

Special cases:
- On [lea.pet](https://lea.pet) and [catgirl.pub](https://catgirl.pub), a handful of people has moderator access, meaning they can theoretically access your account, messages and files. \
  While I trust these people to be responsible with their power, I can not guarantee this. You have been warned.

### Data Safety

***I CAN NOT GUARANTEE DATA INTEGRITY.***

I do my best to keep backups of everything, but mistakes happen, and it is always possible that I accidentally lose your data. Do not store any important information on my servers, unless you have backups. You should also encrypt sensitive data before uploading it.

I also do not make any uptime guarantees. I try my best, but things break and go down.
